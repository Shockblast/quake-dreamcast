Quake for Dreamcast

	BERO <bero@geocities.co.jp>
	http://dcquake.sourceforge.net

- you should set joypad config in options/customize control before starting game.

Status

 - working quake and glquake
 - quake: sometimes buggy color.
 (I think -m4-single-only (double=32bit) overflow or compiler/math library bug in lighting code)
 - glquake: transpalency bug
 - both run with shareware version data files or commercial CD-ROM.
 - MOD/TC can work.
 - full control using pad (except console) , and mouse,keyboard support
 - sound
 - save to visual memory with zlib compression and icon
 - cd-da music (but disabled -- if you read data from pc using dcload-ip and cd-da from cd, work fine)
 - no network

How to run

- it runs CD-R or CD-ROM, dcload-ip with this directory structure:

burned Quake sharware version:
\QUAKE_SW
  +- ID1
       +- glquake (optional*)
       +- PAK0.PAK

burned Quake commercial version full install:
\QUAKE
  +- ID1
  |    +- glquake (optional*)
  |    +- PAK0.PAK
  |    +- PAK1.PAK
  |    +- quakeXX.pcx or quakeXX.tga (optional)
  +- other mod (optional)
  +- other mod (optional)
  +- games.lst (optional)

(*) glquake directory is genarated when you run glquake on PC, 
 or mkdir by hand and run under dcload-ip.
 if this directory exist, loading faster.

Quake commercial version CD-ROM:
\Data
  +- ID1
       +- glquake
       +- PAK0.PAK
       +- PAK1.PAK

dcload-ip:

same as burned image but on pc harddrive.
if quake directory is at C:\QUAKE, under cygwin enviroment, 
$ mount -b 'C:\quake' /quake
and
$ dcload-ip -t <dreamcast ip> glquake.elf


Add mod/map/TC

I suggest you run under dcload-ip before burning.

1. Intall/Extract in Quake directory.
2. read it's document
3. make "games.lst" in Quake directory

example
--cut--
#gamename,dir,cmdline,screenshot,txt
Quake,id1,,quake00.pcx,
After the Fall,atf,,quake00.pcx,atf.txt
Beyond Belief,bbelief,,quake00.pcx,BBELIEF.DOC
Abyss of Pandemonium,IMPEL,,quake00.pcx,README.TXT
AirQuake,AIRQUAKE,,quake00.pcx,AIRQUAKE.TXT
TeamFortress,FORTRESS,,quake00.pcx,README.TXT
Soldier of Fortune,sof,,quake00.pcx,SOFSP1.TXT
Raptors!,raptors,,quake00.pcx,README.TXT
--cut--

if cmdline is only "-game dirname" then you can omit cmdline.
To make screenshot, run under dcload-ip and press F12 on DC keyboard, or run (gl)quake on PC with 320x200 or 320x240 resolution.
